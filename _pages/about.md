Beside mathematics, I enjoy cooking and more generally experiment in the kitchen. If I feel like it I might write down some notes on recipes/techniques I have played with (e.g. spherification and whatnot).

I used to play Bridge semi-decently and I still enjoy my odd game against BBO's bots. Again, if I can gather the energy, I'll write down a convention card for my old system (I want to have the Gazilli convention written down somewhere). I really want to try and make an interactive declaration page but it is an excessive amount of work to be honest.
