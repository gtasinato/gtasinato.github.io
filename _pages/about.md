I have completed my PhD in July 2025 under the supervision of [Uli Wagenr](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/wagner-group/) at the Institure of Science and Technology Austria. 
My thesis is on applications of topological combinatorics to two combiantiorial problems (mainly approximate graph colourings and mass partitioning); it can be found [here](https://research-explorer.ista.ac.at/record/20339).

I attended [Università di Pisa](https://www.dm.unipi.it/) and [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/it) for both my Bachelor and Master degree in Mathematics. 

My Bachelor's supervisor was [Prof. Riccardo Benedetti](https://people.dm.unipi.it/benedett/) while for my Master thesis I worked under the joint supervision of [Prof. Stefano Marmi](https://homepage.sns.it/marmi/) and [Dr. Marcello Paris](https://it.linkedin.com/in/marcelloparis).

## Beyond Mathematics

I enjoy cooking and more generally experiment in the kitchen. If I feel like it I might write down some notes on recipes/techniques I have played with (e.g. spherification and whatnot).

I used to play Bridge semi-decently and I still enjoy my odd game against BBO's bots. Again, if I can gather the energy, I'll write down a convention card for my old system (I want to have the Gazilli convention written down somewhere). I really want to try and make an interactive declaration page but it is an excessive amount of work to be honest.
