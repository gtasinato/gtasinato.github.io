I attended [Universit√† di Pisa](https://www.dm.unipi.it/) and [Scuola Normale Superiore](https://www.sns.it/it) for both my Bachelor and Master degree in Mathematics. 

My Bachelor's supervisor was [Prof. Riccardo Benedetti](https://people.dm.unipi.it/benedett/) while for my Master thesis I worked under the joint supervision of [Prof. Stefano Marmi](https://homepage.sns.it/marmi/) and [Dr. Marcello Paris](https://it.linkedin.com/in/marcelloparis).

## Beyond Mathematics

I enjoy cooking and more generally experiment in the kitchen. If I feel like it I might write down some notes on recipes/techniques I have played with (e.g. spherification and whatnot).

I used to play Bridge semi-decently and I still enjoy my odd game against BBO's bots. Again, if I can gather the energy, I'll write down a convention card for my old system (I want to have the Gazilli convention written down somewhere). I really want to try and make an interactive declaration page but it is an excessive amount of work to be honest.
