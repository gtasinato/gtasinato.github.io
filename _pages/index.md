I am Gianluca Tasinato, a PhD student in [Uli Wagner](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/wagner-group/) research group at the Institute of Science of Technology Austria ([ISTA](https://www.ista.ac.at)).

My main math interests are in the field of so-called "Topological Combinatorics"; in particular, the main problems I am working on are:


1. Hardness of Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problems (PCSPs)
2. Quantitative Borsuk-Ulam type results (with a focus towards Sierksma Dutch Cheese problem)
3. Measure splitting theorems / Intersection counting problems

# About this Page
This is my homepage, where I'll collect my experiments in web dev and programming more generally.

Additionally, it will slowly become a sort of portfolio/CV of mine, for the world to see! :D

Hopefully there will be some math as well; however the place is going to be a bit empty for the foreseeable future.
