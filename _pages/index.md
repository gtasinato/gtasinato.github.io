I am Gianluca Tasinato, a postdoc in [Standa Živný](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/standa.zivny/) research group in the department of Computer Science at [Oxford University](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk).

My main interests are in the field of so-called "Topological Combinatorics"; focussing in particular to applications of topology to the study of (Promise) Constraint Satisfaction Problems.

Additionally, I am still interested in some different questions from Topological Combinatorics; specifically:

2. Quantitative Borsuk-Ulam type results (with a focus towards Sierksma Dutch Cheese problem)
3. Measure splitting theorems / Intersection counting problems
