I am Gianluca Tasinato, a (future) postdoc in [Standa Živný](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/standa.zivny/) research group in the department of Computer Science at Oxford University.

My main interests are in the field of so-called "Topological Combinatorics"; focussing in particular to applications of topology to the study of (Promise) Constraint Satisfaction Problems.

Additionally, I am still interested in some different questions from Topological Combinatorics; specifically:

2. Quantitative Borsuk-Ulam type results (with a focus towards Sierksma Dutch Cheese problem)
3. Measure splitting theorems / Intersection counting problems

# About this Page

This is my homepage, where I'll collect my experiments in web dev and programming more generally.

Additionally, it will slowly become a sort of portfolio/CV of mine, for the world to see! :D

Hopefully there will be some math as well; however the place is going to be a bit empty for the foreseeable future.
