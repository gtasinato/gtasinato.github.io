An eight-partition of a finite set of points (respectively, of a continuous mass distribution) in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$ consists of three planes that divide the space into octants, such that each open octant contains at most $$1/8$$ of the points (respectively, of the mass). In 1966, Hadwiger showed that any mass distribution in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$ admits an eight-partition; moreover, one can prescribe the normal direction of one of the three planes. The analogous result for finite point sets follows by a standard limit argument. We prove the following variant of this result: Any mass distribution (or point set) in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$ admits an eight-partition for which the intersection of two of the planes is a line with a prescribed direction. Moreover, we present an efficient algorithm for calculating an eight-partition of a set of points in $$\mathbb{R}^3$$ (with prescribed normal direction of one of the planes) in time $$O^*(n^{5/2})$$.
